# Snakes and Ladders

To start the game:

1. The server needs to be started on a machine
2. If players want to play on the same machine as the server, then just start the player client on the machine
3. If players are on different machines, then the server and the players need to connect to a common LAN. The players need to know the servers IP.
4. Enjoy the game

Features:

1. There are three types of boards
2. A player opens a room, chooses the board he wants to play on, others join that room, the creator of the room starts the game
3. There can be many such rooms, each with different boards
4. The dice is fair by default, this can be changed to make it favor one or more sides.
5. There is a mode where each player gets a fixed number of chances to roll an unfair (according to their liking) dice.
6. Each board has its own sound and visual effects.

It was painful to create cubic curved paths for the pieces using JavaFX to fit the warped bodies of the snakes.
